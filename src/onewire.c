/**
 * Search procedure for the next ROM addresses
 *
 * This algorithm is bit difficult to understand from the diagrams in Maxim's
 * datasheets and app notes, though its reasonably straight forward once
 * understood.  I've used the name "last zero branch" instead of Maxim's name
 * "last discrepancy", since it describes how this variable is used.
 *
 * A device address has 64 bits. With multiple devices on the bus, some bits
 * are ambiguous.  Each time an ambiguous bit is encountered, a zero is written
 * and the position is marked.  In subsequent searches at ambiguous bits, a one
 * is written at this mark, zeros are written after the mark, and the bit in
 * the previous address is copied before the mark. This effectively steps
 * through all addresses present on the bus.
 *
 * For reference, see either of these documents:
 *
 *  - Maxim application note 187: 1-Wire Search Algorithm
 *    https://www.maximintegrated.com/en/app-notes/index.mvp/id/187
